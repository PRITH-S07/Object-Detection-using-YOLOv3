# Object-Detection-using-YOLOv3
<p>
Here, I have used the YOLOv3 algorithm (pre-trained) to perform object detection. This algorithm has been pre-trained on the coco dataset. 
It's weights file is available on the YOLO website and by using the command of:<br>
git clone https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet
You can clone this repository and take all the required files. The image I have used in my code is available in the repository.
